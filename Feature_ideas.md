## Episode specific
 - Contestant performance for particular episode (Star Baker, fav, least fav)
 - Cumulative contestant performance (how many times they've gotten SB, fav, least fav)

   - For this I may want to look up recipes and generate features based on recipe attributes (num of ingredients, num of steps, word count)

 - Density of contestant hometown
   - note: the reason I'm not doing area is that it seems to be more difficult to get that than the above two
